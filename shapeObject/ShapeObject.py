        Further Information
        --------------------
        Geometry can be grouped into three core collection types: Points, Lines and Polygons. Some of these types have
        multiple sub types, for example a polygon may be a single polygon or a multipolygon. This extracts the geometry
        and returns lists of each homogeneous type. In the case of multiple types in a given shapefile, if records where
        not indexed by type, then the length of records would not match the type leading to problems.

        Note
        ------
        I am aware that shapely has homogeneous groupings, these features are necessary when loading in geometry via a
        shapefile. However if a Shapely Multipolygon is used on all the geometry that is constructed i lose the
        IntelliSense for the objects which is undesirable but probably an error on my part. As such these are just
        lists of Shapely geometry types rather than a Shapely Geometry collection OF Shapely geometry types

        Warning
        -----
        Currently does not have support for multi-linestrings, or linear rings.

        If a polygon_point_set's length is only equal to one, then it will just be a simple polygon without any holes
        within it, otherwise there are holes in the polygon. The way that Esri encodes the polygons is that the first
        coordinate set of points is the shape with holes in it, and all other sets of points are the holes which are
        encoded in a counter clockwise manner so that the system knows it is a hole when drawing it. Shapely works the
        exact same way, the first instance is the polygons hull with the second optional argument being a list counter
        clockwise points sets that represent the holes

        A polygon may not be valid, which may lead to problems using shapely functions later on. If an invalid polygon
